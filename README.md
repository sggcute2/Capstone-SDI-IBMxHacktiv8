## 🎯 Project Overview

This Memory Game challenges players to match pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. It emphasizes:

- Dynamic DOM rendering
- Efficient event handling
- Optimized game logic
- Apply performance-conscious coding design patterns
- Deliver a smooth user experience across devices
- Clean JavaScript code

> 🏆 Developed as a **Capstone Project** for the **Student Development Initiative** organized by **IBM x Hacktiv8**.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click any card to flip it.
2. Flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs.
3. Matched cards stay revealed; unmatched cards flip back.
4. Complete all pairs with the fewest moves and shortest time.
5. View your total move counter when the game ends and click reset button to restart the game.
